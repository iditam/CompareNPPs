This version of NPP was created by Idit Bloch on June 2018 using these steps:

- Downloaded all *.fasta.gz files from ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/reference_proteomes/Eukaryota/

- Ordered the species upon the taxonomy browser of NCBI and then use nwutils to re-root the tree, from Homo_sapiens
